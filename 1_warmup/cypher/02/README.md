# How I got here

* For the first part of my epic voyage, consult the README.md in the `01` directory
* This, in turn, was more straightforward:
  * In Terminal.app, I'm still in the first warmup directory. So I `cd .. && mkcd 02`.
  * ... and then run `vim README.md`
  * ... and type out these words you are reading right now
  * Then I remember I'm not on a new topic branch yet. So I background vim, and run `git checkout -b second-warumup`
  * Followed by `git add README.md` and `git commit -m "My second warmup"`
  * Then I push my stuff via `git push origin second-warmup`
  * And create my pull request
